# entropy-estimation-and-language-modelling-for-various-languages-using-social-media-
## Introduction
This master's thesis, undertaken as part of the MSc in Computational Software Techniques in Engineering at Cranfield University, investigates the complexities of language by examining the unpredictability and intricate patterns inherent in human communication. Utilizing entropy as a quantifiable measure, the study analyses patterns a within various interaction including social media, literature, and programming languages.

## Key Metrics
•	Languages Studied: English (EN), Arabic(AR)
•	Programming Languages: C++, Python, C and fortran
•	Data Collection: +300 Millions of Tweets Collected, ~80Gb of Data processed
•	Entropy Estimation:  

## Objectives of the project
1.	Analyze Entropy in Twitter :  Analyzing major languages on Twitter.

2.	Assess Media Language Styles: Analyzing major languages on Twitter. Study news outlets unique entropy patterns.
3.	Explore Programming Languages Entropy

## Workflows
Here is the general workflow of the project:

### Data
#### Social Media Data
For the Social Media data, Twitter was used as the main source. The data was collected using scraping, streaming and Twitter API. A total of around 200-300 million tweets were collected, using different methods.
#### Computer Language Data
For the Computer Language data, the data was collected using GitHub API. Also data was srapped from …. ,  CodeNet is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of programmatic source code. It contains 14M code samples from 55 programming languages

## Data Acquisition
Collect data from Twitter using scraping, streaming and Twitter API.

## Pre-processing
Pre-processing of the data includes the following steps:
•	Cleaning
•	Data Manipulation
•	Tokenization

## Entropy Estimation
The entropy estimation used different methods to estimate the entropy of the text. The methods used are:
•	Entropy Rate

## Analysis
The Analysis is designed to generated graphs and extracts insights from the performed analysis
